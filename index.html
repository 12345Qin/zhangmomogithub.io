        <p>
            In 2018,they made a speech at the United Nations.RM told a story about himself in fluent English.When they made the public appearance,they were despised by others and the company was heavily indebted.They did not get the first one until 2015.Now they are becoming more and more popular,not only in South Korea,but also all over the world.But they did not forget their orignal intention.

        <h3>Projects in Brackets</h3>
        <p>
            My favourite album is "Love yourself".The album really encourages a lot when I am down.Parents will say that you need to be better than others.Teachers will say that you need to be a good leaner.Only BTS say that you should love yourself.Just as RM said"No matter who you are ,where are you from,your skin colour,your gender identity.Just speak yourself.Find your name and plenty of mistakes in my life.I love many faults and I have many more fears.But I am gonna embrace myself as hard as I can.And I am starting to love myself gradually just little by little.What is your name,speak yourself".

            Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
            in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
            folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folderâ€¦"
            to open your own folder.
            You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
            sample project.

        <h3>Quick Edit for CSS and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            In 2016,I think the best decision I have ever made was to become a fan of them.I can be proud to say that I am Army, the fan name of BTS.They are not only like my idols,but also like my life teachers.They are not idols,they are artists.

            Want to see it in action? Place your cursor on the <!-- <samp> --> tag above and press
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd>. You should see a CSS quick editor appear above, showing the CSS rule that
            applies to it. Quick Edit works in class and id attributes as well. You can use it with your
            LESS and SCSS files also.
            
            You can create new rules the same way. Click in one of the <!-- <p> --> tags above and press
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd>. There are no rules for it right now, but you can click the New Rule
            button to add a new rule for <!-- <p> -->.

            If you have Google Chrome installed, you can try this out yourself. Click on the lightning bolt
            icon in the top right corner of your Brackets window or hit <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + P</kbd>. When
            Live Preview is enabled on an HTML document, all linked CSS documents can be edited in real-time.
            The icon will change from gray to gold when Brackets establishes a connection to your browser.
            
            Now, place your cursor on the <!-- <img> --> tag above. Notice the blue highlight that appears
            around the image in Chrome. Next, use <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> to open up the defined CSS rules.
            Try changing the size of the border from 10px to 20px or change the background
            color from "transparent" to "hotpink". If you have Brackets and your browser running side-by-side, you
            will see your changes instantly reflected in your browser. Cool, right?

            To try out Quick View for yourself, place your cursor on the <!-- <body> --> tag at the top of this
            document and press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> to open a CSS quick editor. Now simply hover over any of the
            color values within the CSS. You can also see it in action on gradients by opening a CSS quick editor
            on the <!-- <html> --> tag and hovering over any of the background image values. To try out the image
            preview, place your cursor over the screenshot image included earlier in this document.
